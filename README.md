# TinyApp Project
> TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLS

## Test Cases

I have tested all the cases multiple times and believe that the app works the way it is suppose to.

## Usage example

For people that like to tweet out multiple links or maybe perhaps you have a really long URL that you would like to shorten.
